# Job Skills & Trends Analysis

This project explores which skills (like Python, SQL, Power BI) are most in demand and how they affect salaries across different job roles and locations.

The goal is to analyze real-world job data to understand which technical skills are most valuable for data-related roles, how trends differ by country or city, and how demand has changed over time.
